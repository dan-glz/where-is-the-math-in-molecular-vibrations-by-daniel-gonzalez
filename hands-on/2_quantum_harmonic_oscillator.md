# The Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (WIP)
To grasp the concepts of this derivation more easily, I recommend watching or reading on the mathematical notation and concepts used in quantum mechanics. This includes the basics of linear algebra and extends but is not limited to knowing Hilbert spaces, operators, and the ket notation system.

I recommend the [following YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nvbBEzfmE8) for a quick but very nice introduction to these topics.

Daniel is currently having a very extensive dive into more complicated mathematical concepts and does not wish to elaborate in this section until he is confident in what he is saying. Thank you for your patience. This will be updated later on.

**Schrodinger's Equation**

$$i\hslash\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}|\Psi\rangle = \hat{H} |\Psi\rangle$$

   why isnt this working
