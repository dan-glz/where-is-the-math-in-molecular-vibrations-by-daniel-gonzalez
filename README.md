# Where is the math in: Molecular Vibrations?
## About Me
My name is Daniel Gonzalez. I am currently studying for a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry with minors in Mathematics and Biological Sciences. Although I initially started as a Biology student, it was during my mathematical courses and my time conducting chemistry research that I fell in love with the abstract worlds of Mathematics and Chemistry. During this time, I began taking more math courses and changed my major to Chemistry; up to now, I have covered the following courses:

- Calculus I
- Calculus II
- Calculus III
- Linear Algebra
- Mathematical Modeling (currently)

While also taking more theoretical courses in Chemistry, such as Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry and Spectroscopy. During these courses, I was able to find applications for the math courses I had taken, and where my interest in theoretical chemistry began. With support from Dr. Jesus Alberto Lopez Dominguez, we began to explore ideas to work on a project regarding molecular vibrations.
